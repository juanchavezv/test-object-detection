    Executes a pipeline to capture video based on CLI arguments, segments objects in the video,
    and closes all related windows.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Parses command line interface data to get configuration or input parameters.
    2. Initializes video capture based on the parsed CLI data.
    3. Segments objects within the captured video stream.
    4. Closes all open windows that were used during the video capture and processing.
